# Goose Alarm
The goose alarm is a sentry alarm and deterrent system, specifcally but not limited to keeping geese away from a small radius of land. The target use case would be for a floating platform or dock, deterring geese from nesting (and pooping) on private property. The advantage on traditional geese deterrent products is the wireless/portable end product and the method by which geese are deterred.

## Project Status
The project is in its infancy as of now. Conducting small-scale research alongside initial prototypes to test project viability. Project will be updated semi-regularly as prototype approaches first rounds of testing.
